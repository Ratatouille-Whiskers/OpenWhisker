# Model Notes

## Whisker Base

### [V1](STL/Whisker%20Base/Whisker%20Base%20V1.stl)

- Was too tall (particularly at the bottom) and would need adjusting if wanting to use the mount for breadboard development

### [V2](STL/Whisker%20Base/Whisker%20Base%20V2.stl)

![Whisker Base V2 image](../Images/Whisker%20Base%20V2.png)

- Adjusted the height so the Sensor can more easily socket into a breadboard when assembled

### [V3](STL/Whisker%20Base/Whisker%20Base%20V3.stl)

![Whisker Base V3 image](<../Images/Whisker Base V3.png>)

- re-centered Silicone Bearing Hole
- added internal cut-out ring in bearing hole so that it can hold better

## Whisker Socket

### [V1](STL/Whisker%20Socket/Whisker%20Socket%20V1.stl)

- The socket is designed to a 3mm diameter (printed) whisker
  - The space for the whisker was 4mm to small and would not work
- The socket for inserting a a 5x1 magnet was also too small and need to be wider

### [V2](STL/Whisker%20Socket/Whisker%20Socket%20V2.stl)

- **CURRENT NEEDS TESTING**

- Increase the sockets by 0.25mm to try and account for print tolerances
  - Done for _Whisker hole_
    - Now hold 3mm diameter rods fine
  - Done for _Magnet hole_
    - Can hold a 5x1 magnet with a drop of super glue

- TODO: _MAYBE_ make it slightly tighter for a press-fit option
