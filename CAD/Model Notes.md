# Model Notes

## Whisker Base

### V1

- Was to tall (particularly at the bottom) and would need adjusting if wanting to use the mount for breadboard development

### V2

- **CURRENT NEEDS TESTING**

- Adjusted the height so the Sensor can more easily socket into a breadboard when assembled

## Whisker Socket

### V1

- The socket is designed to a 3mm diameter (printed) whisker
  - The space for the whisker was 4mm to small and would not work
- The socket for inserting a a 5x1 magnet was also too small and need to be wider

### V2

- **CURRENT NEEDS TESTING**

- Increase the sockets by 0.25mm to try and account for print tolerances
  - Done for _Whisker hole_
  - Done for _Magnet hole_
